Week 1: Solidity Fundamentals & Smart Contract Basics

📌 Goal: Master Solidity syntax, contract structure, and simple implementations.

             Day 1: Install & Set Up Development Environment

Ensure Foundry (forge install), Remix, and VS Code are ready.

Deploy a basic “Hello World” contract on Sepolia using Foundry.

             Day 2: Learn Solidity Data Types & Storage
 
Implement a contract using uint, bool, string, bytes, address, mapping, and structs.

             Day 3: Functions, Modifiers, and Visibility

Write a contract with public, private, internal, and external functions.

Implement require(), assert(), and revert() for input validation.
